# asmdoskit

A toolkit for experimenting with DOS assembly. This includes portable DOSBox 0.74-3 binaries and some assembly tools like DEBUG, TASM and TLINK.
## How to use

1. Clone repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/timjtc/asmdoskit.git
    cd asmdoskit
    ```
2. Run start.bat to start DOSBox. If you want to mount a custom directory where your assembly experiments reside, provide a directory path to be mounted. If not, just press enter or provide no input to proceed with mounting the default `mnt_d` directory.
